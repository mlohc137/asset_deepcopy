# Asset DeepCopy

The initial goal of this project was to create a portal where users can 
add Ethereum addresses to a "portfolio" that would be used for tracking 
asset weights based on a given date. 

Users typically do not keep all their assets in one wallet, and do not have a
simple way to track historically their portfolio weights. The app would allow you 
to combine querying data for a set of addresses and view their weights in a 
visually appealing interface.

In it's current state, it's just a frontend, the backend is a skeleteon that reads from a 
etherscan JSON dump for testing. This was mostly a learning experiment with React and frontend frameworks.

Eventually settled on Tailwind which is what the current version is built with.
