# Asset DeepCopy

The initial goal of this project is to create a portal where users can 
add Ethereum addresses to a "portfolio" that would be used for tracking 
asset weights based on a given date. 

Users typically do not keep all their assets in one wallet, and do not have a
simple way to track historically their portfolio weights. This app allows you 
to combine querying data for a set of addresses and view their weights in a 
visually appealing interface.
